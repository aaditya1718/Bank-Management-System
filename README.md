# Bank-Management-System
Here we have made a Bank Management System. For front end development we have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and for backend development we have used PHP and MySQL.
This project is basically creating a database management system for the transaction that are being taken place in thebank. Aim of the project is to creating a backend
program of the processes taking place using SQL. This model deals with the relationship between the customer and Bank. The other entities play a supportive weak
role. So basically this helps the banks to debit or credit the amount of the customer from hisrespective account and also keep the record of his/her transaction made.
